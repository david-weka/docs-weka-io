# Adding Clients

When launching a WekaIO cluster, either through the [self-service portal](self-service-portal.md) or via a [CloudFormation template](cloudformation.md), you may also launch client instances as part of the cluster.

However, sometimes you may want to add more clients after the cluster has been installed.

To add more clients as separate instances, follow the instructions below:

### Step 1: Launch New Instances {#step-1-launch-new-instances}

New client instances have to be of one of the types in [Supported EC2 Instance Types](supported-ec2-instance-types.md).

There are a few things to ensure when launching the new clients:

* New clients must have the same **security group** as the other client/backend instances
* The clients **IAM role** must be the same as other client/backend instances
* The clients must be in the same **subnet** as other client/backend instances in the same AZ
* The clients **root volume** has to be at least 48GiB in size and of either `GP2` or `IO1` types

### Step 2: Install WekaIO Software {#step-2-install-wekaio-software}

To download the WekaIO software, go to [https://get.weka.io ](https://get.weka.io/) and select the version you want to download.

After selecting the version, select the operating system youâ€™re installing on and run the download command-line as `root`on all your new client instances.

When download is complete, untar the downloaded package and run the `install.sh` script contained in the package directory.

**ENA Driver Notice**

If you're installing on an AWS instance with Elastic Network Adapter \(ENA\) but your kernel is not up-to-date, you may need to install the ENA drivers yourself or upgrade to a more recent operating-system version.

The ENA driver is automatically available on recent operating-systems such as RedHat/Centos 7.4, Ubuntu 16 and Amazon Linux 2017.09.
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Add Clients To Cluster {#step-3-add-clients-to-cluster}

Now that the WekaIO software is installed, the clients are ready to join the cluster.

To add the clients, run the following command on each of the client instances:

```text
weka local run -e WEKA_HOST=<backend-ip> aws-add-client <client-instance-id>
```

where `<backend-ip>` is the IP addresses or hostname of one of the backend instances.

**Dedicated Client Resources**

Once `aws-add-client` is done running, one core and 1.4GB of RAM are allocated for WekaIO on the client instance.

This is done as part of WekaIO's pre-allocation of resources, ensuring that variance in client activity doesn't result in allocation of resources that might affect the programs running on the client host.
{% endhint %}

### Step 4: Mount Filesystem On Clients {#step-4-mount-filesystem-on-clients}

You can now mount the filesystems on the clients instances. For example, this command would mount the `default`filesystem under `/mnt/weka`:

```text
mkdir -p /mnt/weka && mount -t wekafs default /mnt/weka
```

To learn about all available mount options, please see the [Mounting Filesystems](../../fs/mounting-filesystems.md) page.
