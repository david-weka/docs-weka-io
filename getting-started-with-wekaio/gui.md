# GUI Overview

The WekaIO system GUI is accessible through one of the servers on port 14000. 

On AWS installations via the self-service portal, the WekaIO system GUI can be accessed by going to the Outputs tab of the CloudFormation stack and clicking the GUI link.

After logging in, the WekaIO dashboard is displayed.

The dashboard enables the viewing of information on the backend host configuration and topology, system alerts and some important statistics.

Clicking the top left button next to the WEKA.IO logo opens a menu bar containing all possible system operations.

From the menu bar, it is possible to view [statistics](../usage/statistics/) and [events](../usage/events/), manage [filesystems](../fs/managing-filesystems/), configure [NFS](../additional-protocols/nfs-support.md) and [SMB](../additional-protocols/smb-support/smb-management-using-the-gui.md) services and manage system [security](../usage/user-management.md) aspects.
