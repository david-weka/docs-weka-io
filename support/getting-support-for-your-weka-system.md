## Recommended Actions

To be ready to get support from WekaIO, it is recommended to perform the following:

1. For each cluster provisioned, [allow uploading events to the support cloud](the-wekaio-support-cloud.md) to enable proactive support and improve the troubleshooting process if needed
2.   Create an account on the WekaIO Support Portal [support.weka.io](http://support.weka.io/).  This will allow you to easily submit and check status of tickets as well as to browse our online knowledgebase.
3. We suggest opening a shared Slack channel with WekaIO for day to day activities, Slack activity will not substitute opening tickets for issues and WekaIO canâ€™t grantee any response time SLA while using Slack. To arrange the slack channel, get in touch with your WekaIO point of contact, open a case in our support portal at [support.weka.io](http://support.weka.io/) or send an email to [support@weka.io](mailto:support@weka.io).
