# NFS Support

## Overview

The NFS protocol allows client hosts to access the Weka filesystem without installing Wekaâ€™s client software using the standard NFS implementation of the client host operating system. While this implementation is easier to deploy, it does not compare in performance to the Weka client.

In order to implement NFS service from a Weka cluster, the following steps must be implemented:

| **Step** | **Method of Implementation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Define a set of hosts that will provide the NFS service, which can be the whole cluster or a subset of the cluster. | By defining an interface group. |
| Define Ethernet ports on each of the defined hosts that will be used to provide the NFS service. | By defining an interface group. |
| Allocate a pool of IP addresses that will be used by the Weka software to provide the NFS service. | By defining an interface group. |
| Define a Round-robin DNS name that will resolve to the floating IPs. | On the local DNS service configuration; does not involve Weka management. |
| Define the list of client hosts that will be permitted to access file systems via NFS. | By creating a client permission group. |
| Configure which client hosts can access which file system. | By creating a client permission group. |
| Mount the file systems on the client hosts using the NFS mount operating system support. | On the client operating system; does not involve Weka management. |

## Implementing NFS Service from a Weka Cluster

### Defining the NFS Networking Configuration \(Interface Groups\)

In order to define the NFS service, one or more interface groups must be defined. An interface group consists of the following:

* A collection of Weka hosts with an Ethernet port for each host, where all the ports must belong to the same layer 2 subnet.
* A collection of floating IPs that serve the NFS protocol on the hosts and ports. All IP addresses must belong to the layer 2 subnet above.
* A routing configuration for the IPs which must comply with the IP network configuration.

Up to 10 different Interface groups can be defined, where multiple interface groups can be used if the cluster needs to connect to multiple layer 2 subnets. Up to 50 hosts can be defined in each interface group.

The Weka system will automatically distribute the IP addresses evenly on each host and port. On a failure of the host, the Weka system will reasonably redistribute the IP addresses associated with the failed host on other hosts. To minimize the effect of any host failures, it is recommended to define sufficient floating IPs so that the Weka system can assign 4 floating IPs per host.

**Note:** The Weka system will configure the host IP networking for the NFS service on the host operating system. It should not be defined by the user.

### Configuring the Round-Robin DNS Server

To ensure that the various NFS clients will balance the load on the various Weka hosts serving NFS, it is recommended to define a [Round-robin DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS) entry which will resolve to the list of floating IPs, ensuring that client loads will be equally distributed across all hosts.

### Defining NFS Access Control \(Client Access Groups\)

In order to control which host can access which file system, NFS client permission groups must be defined. Each NFS client permission group contains:

* A list of filters for IP addresses or DNS names of clients that can be connected to the Weka system via NFS.
* A collection of rules that control access to specific filesystems.

### Configuring NFS on the Client

The NFS mount should be configured on the client host via the standard NFS stack operating system. The NFS server IP address should point to the Round-robin DNS name defined above.

## Load Balancing and Resiliency of the NFS Service

The Weka NFS service is a scalable, fully load-balanced and resilient service which provides continuous service through failures of any kind.

Scalability is implemented by defining many hosts that serve the NFS protocol, thereby enabling the scaling of performance by adding more hosts to the interface group.

Load balancing is implemented via floating IPs. By default, the floating IPs are evenly distributed over all the interface group hosts/ports. When different clients resolve the DNS name into an IP service, each of them receives a different IP address, thereby ensuring that different clients will access different hosts. This allows the Weka system to scale and service thousands of clients.

The same mechanism ensures the resiliency of the service. On a host failure, all IP addresses associated with the failed host will be reassigned to other hosts \(using the GARP network messages\) and the clients will reconnect to the new hosts without any reconfiguration or service interruption.
