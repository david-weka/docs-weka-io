# Statistics

## Overview

As the WekaIO system runs, it collects hundreds of statistics on system performance. These statistics help in analyzing the WekaIO system performance and determining the source of any problems.

Five different categories of statistics are available for review - Operations \(NFS\), Operations \(Driver\), Object Store, SSD and CPU â€“ and when each category is selected, a list of the possible statistics that can be selected is displayed.

By default, the main statistics page displays the last hour of operation, presenting the WekaIO system operation per second on a time axis.

![Statistics View Screen](../.gitbook/assets/statistics-main-screen.png)

This Statistics view screen offers a number of options to drill-down into the statistics, according to category. Options include:

* Mousing over the scrollable graph area to view various performance metrics of the WekaIO matrix cluster.
* Troubleshooting or obtaining a correlation between events and performance \(using the top line which provides links to events that occurred\).
* Adding more statistics to the view \(using the Statistics menu\).
* Displaying different statistics simultaneously and toggling between them. By default, the graph area shows Ops/sec for the last hour. Using the "Hour, Day, Week" buttons

  at the bottom-right enables changing of the time interval.

* Displaying, hiding. deleting, and zooming-in on statistics from defined timelines and dates.
* Bookmarking specific statistics for future reference and sharing with others \(using the URL\).

## Working with Statistics Using the GUI

### Viewing Statistics

To view the statistics screen using the GUI, click the statistics button on the left bar:  

![Statistics View Screen](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-07-29-11-47-29.png)

### Adding Statistics

To select the addition of specific statistics, click the + Add Statistics tab on the right-hand side of the Statistics view screen. The statistics menu will be displayed.

![Add Statistics Tab](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-07-29-11-55-54.png)

![Statistics Menu](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-07-29-12-03-48.png)

Then select the component for which statistics required from the six possible categories. As each component is selected, the list of possible Statistics Names that can be selected changes. It is also possible to searching for a specific statistic by typing the name of the statistic in the Filter field at the top of the menu. 

Up to 5 different statistics can be displayed simultaneously. Selecting a metric adds its graph to the Statistics view, together with a selector containing the category and name of the statistics which are displayed according to the appropriate units. 

Switching the active unit scale is performed by clicking on one of the inactive units displayed in the left bottom corner of the graph display box.

### Hiding/Deleting Statistics

To hide or delete statistics from a graph, mouse-over the selector and click either the Hide or Delete button appearing under the selector.

![Example of Hide/Delete Buttons ](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-07-29-13-13-57.png)

### Specifying a Time Frame

To define a specific period of time \(start and end\) for the statistics to be displayed, click the From and To selectors appearing in the left corner of the graph display box. Then select the date of the statistics required from the calendar popup and the hours from the right scroller, or by using the up and down arrows that appear when hovering on the time selectors.

![From/To Time Selectors](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-07-29-14-44-31.png)

![Calendar Popup](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-07-29-15-01-39.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** It is also possible to change the time period by dragging the graph left or right.
{% endhint %}

The Auto Refresh setting offers another option for defining a specific period of time. Activation of Auto Refresh is performed by clicking on one of the buttons displayed in the right bottom corner of the graph display box, according to the desired period \(hour, day or week\). The selected period of time for the statistics will be automatically updated every minute, until Auto Refresh is deactivated by clicking the 'x' button located at the top right of the Auto Refresh tool tip, or by defining a period of time using the time selector.

### Obtaining a Summary of Events

To obtain a summary of events that occurred in a specific time period, click the events bubble displayed above the graph. The Events popup will be displayed.  Expand the popup in order to obtain a detailed list of events. Click on the icon next to each event to link to the selected event in the Events view screen.

## Working with Statistics Using the CLI

**Command:** `weka stats`

Use the following command line to obtain statistics definition information:  
`weka stats list-types`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This command can be filtered according to names or categories of statistics \(when the name or category are defined\).
{% endhint %}

Use the following command line to obtain the current performance status of the hosts:  
`weka stats realtime`

Use the following command line to manage filters and read statistics:  
`weka stats --start-time=<start> [--end-time=<end>] [--category=<category>]... [--stat=<stat>]... [--resolution-secs=<secs>] [--accumulated] [--node-ids=<node>...] [--param=<key:val>]... [--no-zeros] [--show-internal] [--per-node]`  
or:

`weka stats --interval=<interval> [--category=<category>]... [--stat=<stat>]... [--resolution-secs=<secs>] [--accumulated] [--node-ids=<node>...] [--param=<key:val>]... [--no-zeros] [--show-internal] [--per-node]`

## List of Statistics Collected

This section details the statistics collected to analyze system performance and determine the source of any problems as the WekaIO system runs, according to the following six categories: Operations, Operations \(NFS\), Operations \(Driver\), Object Storage, SSD and CPU. When each category is selected, a list of the possible statistics that can be selected is displayed.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** All statistics are averaged over 1 second intervals. Consequently, "total" or other aggregates relate to a specific minute.
