# Expansion of Specific Resources

## Expansion of Only SSDs

The addition of new SSDs only to existing servers requires execution of the following stages:

1. [Configuration of SSDs](../../install/bare-metal/untitled.md#stage-6-configuration-of-ssds)
2. [Scanning Drives](../../install/bare-metal/untitled.md#stage-7-scanning-drives)
3. [Activation of Cluster SSDs](../../install/bare-metal/untitled.md#stage-14-activation-of-cluster-ssds)

## Addition of Only CPU Cores

The addition of only CPU cores to the cluster requires execution of [Configuration of CPU Resources](../../install/bare-metal/untitled.md#stage-8-configuration-of-cpu-resources).
